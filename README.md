# RSA-key-generator
## About
This is a python program that is able to:
* Generate public and private RSA key pairs
* Encrypt text using a public RSA key
* Decrypt text using a private RSA key

The keys are generate using maths I have code from scratch (expect some functions from math).

Text is encrypted and decrypted are also use maths I have code from scratch (expect some functions from math) also with a custom protocal for formatting encrypted text.
